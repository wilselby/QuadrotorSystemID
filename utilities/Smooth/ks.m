function [Xtrain,Xtest,Ytrain,Ytest]=ks(X,Y,Num)
%  ks selects the samples XSelected which uniformly distributed in the exprimental data X's space
%  Input 
%         X:the matrix of the sample spectra
%         Num:the number of the sample spectra you want select 
%  Output
%         XSelected:the sample spectras was selected from the X
%         XRest:the sample spectras remain int the X after select
%         vSelectedRowIndex:the row index of the selected sample in the X matrix
